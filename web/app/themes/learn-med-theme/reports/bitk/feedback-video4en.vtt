00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000


2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.980
I don't know why this isn't working...

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.580
I normally don't have issues with this! 

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.110
I've noticed a couple of things that, if we reajust, 
can make a real difference. 

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.150
What do you think of your landmarking?

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.170
Well, I mean, I am using a lateral approach. I've identified the patella. 

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.400
I'm going in the lower portion of it. I don't know why it's not working. 

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.320
So, you're correct about your landmarking, 

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.470
especially using the patella as your landmark 

10
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.430
but remember the synovium is mostly found at 
the surperior part of the knee

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.600
so if you use the superior approach that might be helpful. 

12
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.300
Ok, I guess I remembered it wrong. I mean that makes more sense.

13
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.520
And there's landmarking and there is positionning as well. 

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750
How would you position a real patient?

15
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.460
Well, normally I would have the patient closer 
to the lateral edge of the bed 

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.450
and then I normally put something under the knee to support it. 

17
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.760
So why don't you attempt it again and try using that technique? Now? 

18
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.760
Let's do it right now! Ok!

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:14.550


20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.080
   Ok!

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.330


22
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.930
Ah! There you go! 

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.120
Excellent, you can see by repositioning the 
patient and releasing the tendons 

24
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.050
that you were able to, even with the mannequin, 
you were able to do that. 

25
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.590
Where did you learn how to do the technique? 

26
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.110
A senior resident showed me in emerg and I read 
up on it today before the session.

27
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.580
Excellent! It is great to learn from peers and also good to read about it

28
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.880
but sometimes you have to watch an expert do it. 

29
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.200
Have you had a chance to watch the videos from 
the New England Journal of Medicine? 

30
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.490
You know what, we got the links for those last year and 

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.990
that's a great idea! I will look at them when I get home.

32
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.490
That would be wonderful. Just another thing, your sterile technique;

33
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.080
the patient's draped properly and you're gowned and masked properly 

34
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.070
but there is another way you can do it. 

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.760
You can use your gloves and your mask as always 

36
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.970
but you can landmark the patient first, sterilise the site,

37
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.360
and then use what is called the no touch technique.

38
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.910
Yes, that is what the resident did in emerg,  

39
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.750
but I'm just more comfortable doing it this way so
 I don't contaminate anything.

40
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.220
From a patient safety perspective you are doing the right thing 

41
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.010
but just to know that you can do the other technique as well. 

42
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.120
Perfect. Ok. Well, thank you! 

43
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.564
Let's clean up and move onto the next station. 
Sounds good!
